I am a boy. I come from China. My Chinese name is Wang Li and my English name is Amy. 
I'm 14 years old. Miss Li is my music teacher. She speaks French. She often helps me learn French. 
I have two good friends in our school. They are Jenny White and Tony Brown. 
They are both Canadian. We all like the same sports. They often play together on the weekend.
